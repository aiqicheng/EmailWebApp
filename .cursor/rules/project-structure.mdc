# Email Campaign Web App - Feature Development Rules

## MVP Scope Definition
**Core Features (Must Implement First):**
- Profile CRUD with email/name/custom_fields (JSON storage)
- List CRUD with many-to-many profile relationships
- Campaign CRUD with scheduling and Postmark integration
- Email logging with Postmark webhook handling
- Basic UI for profile/list/campaign management

**Technical Requirements:**
- SQLite database with proper indexing
- UTC timestamp handling throughout
- Try-except blocks for all external API calls
- Comprehensive error logging
- Stateless Flask app design
- Celery for async task processing

## Feature Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Database-First Approach
- All features must have proper database models before UI implementation
- Use SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Store all timestamps in UTC

### 2. API Design Standards
- RESTful CRUD endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Pagination for all list endpoints
- Bulk operations for profile-list relationships
- Webhook endpoints for external service integration
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

### 3. UI/UX Patterns
- List management with search/filter capabilities
- Campaign editor with rich text support
- Email log viewer with filtering
- Profile detail views with event history
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### 4. External Integration
- Postmark API for email sending
- Webhook handling for delivery status updates
- Timeout and retry logic for all external calls
- Proper error handling for API failures

### 5. Performance Requirements
- Async processing for long-running tasks
- Database query optimization (avoid N+1)
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Horizontal scaling preparation

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual features
- Integration tests for dependent features
- API endpoint testing
- Error scenario testing

## Implementation Priority Order
1. Database models and migrations
2. Core CRUD APIs (profiles, lists, campaigns)
3. Postmark integration and email sending
4. Webhook handling and email logging
5. Basic UI for all core features
6. Advanced features (flows, analytics)
